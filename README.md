# Credit Scoring Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for credit scoring classification. The goal is to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not, based on various financial and demographic features. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.

## Key Steps and Methodology
- **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  - Loaded a credit scoring dataset and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
  - Visualized data using plots to identify trends and outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features for optimal model performance.
- **Model Building:**
  - Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and possibly others.
  - Used train-test split and cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Visualized confusion matrices and ROC curves for deeper insights.
- **Feature Importance:**
  - Analyzed feature importances to interpret which variables most influence credit risk predictions.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Summarized findings and recommended the best-performing model for credit scoring.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Resume Summary
